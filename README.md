# THE-TO-DO-APP

Came with the well known app as it's for beginner and I'm still on my learning stage.
The To-Do app where we can write down what we have to do in our day.Simple and clean UI using html css javascript only and here I've used localStorage so that after refreshing or reopening the page our list should remain same and if we delete any of the list it will show you the updated list.
We can delete a particular list by just clicking on the cross button on the right side of every list.
Dont forget to give your feedback in comment section #javascript #html #css .


And below is the demo video
